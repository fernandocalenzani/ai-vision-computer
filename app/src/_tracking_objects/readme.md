# COMPUTER VISION - OBJECT TRACKING

## Important Topics

Here are some of the key topics I will be covering during this study project:
```
- Tracking objects VS object detection
- KFC (Kernel Correlation Filters)
- CSRT (Discriminative Correlation Filter with Channel and Spatial Reliability)
- Use the information available to tracking the object
- Detecting object one time, you dont need to detect again
- good to use with some pictures parts ommited (hands in face or another thing)
```
### KCF (Kernel Correlation Filters)

### CSRT ( DISCRIMINATIVE CORRELATION FILTER WITH CHANNEL AND SPATIAL RELIABILITY)
```
 - Training patch
 - HOG to extract the image informations
 - Random Markov Test to generate probabilities
 - Training Patch using confidence map
```
